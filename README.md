# SteamPrex

## Deprecated since Steam removed regional prices for Argentina

### Amazing discord bot that calculates taxes and currency conversion from argentinian peso to uruguayan peso automatically when you send a Steam store link or use the comand !sp and the game title.


The conversion is scraped from Prex's website which is the one we uruguayans use to buy Steam games with Argentina's regional price.

The search function is done by searching the command input on the Steam store website.

Currencies are scraped on start up, a function to scrape every x time could be added but it is faster to just setup a cronjob to run it every time you want.

Examples:
